# Housing Price Prediction

This project uses a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on various features such as number of rooms, population, and median income.

## 🔍 Dataset
The dataset is based on the California Housing Prices dataset from the book "Hands-On Machine Learning" by Aurélien Géron.  
It includes information like:
- Median income
- Average number of rooms
- Housing age
- Population
- Latitude & longitude

## 📊 Technologies
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn
- Google Colab

## 🧠 Model
The model is a basic **Linear Regression**, trained with scikit-learn on numeric features only.

## 📈 Results
- **RMSE:** _e.g._ 68,000  
- **MAE:** _e.g._ 52,000

## 📎 Notebook
The full code is available in `housing_price_prediction.ipynb`.  
You can try it yourself in Google Colab.
